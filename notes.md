I was very busy this weekend (due to LDS General Conference). I worked when I could, but I couldn't remember how to properly call an API with Axios. I was trying to use the API call from the home page, but it wasn't working. I spent a lot of my working time looking up how to do it, but to no avail. I added Beers and Breweries components and that's where I ended up.
